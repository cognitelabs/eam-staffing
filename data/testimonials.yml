- testimonial: "I recently experienced the recruiting services of EAM Staffing. I had reached out on a job posting and after a quick discussion with EAM, determined that it was an entry level position and not appropriate for my background and experience. They said that they would keep me in mind if a more appropriate opportunity came up. Of course, I thought that was the end of it. Surprisingly to me, I got a call about a month later from them about a potential position that seemed like a great match. EAM set up the interviews and kept me abreast of progress throughout the interview process. This led to an offer and my acceptance of a Sales Director position. <br/><br/>EAM Staffing (Brandon & Mike in particular) were very professional, forthright and determined as they represented me and their client. I would highly recommend EAM Staffing for your recruiting needs!"
