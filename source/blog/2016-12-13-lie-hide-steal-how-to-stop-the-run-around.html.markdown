All of us have had the unpleasant experience of someone trying to sell us on something we don’t want. All of us have lied, hidden, and stolen to get out of that situation.

For those of us who think “this can’t be me, I’m a saint”, picture this: you’ve entered a department store, in search of a sweater, and are helplessly hunted down by the floor sales representative. You see them, bee- lining right for you, and you immediately consider your options:

1. Run out of the store (but then you might miss that perfect sale sweater).
2. Hide in the next rack over (but then you risk looking like a fool).
3. Lie to their face, “No thanks, I am just looking”. 

Most of us choose option three, we **Lie.**

Now you are walking over to the sweater section and another representative saunters over and asks you the same. 

You reply that you’re looking for something soft, durable, and machine washable. This representative opens the vault of sweater knowledge and drowns you in it. You’ve just learned everything you’ll ever need (or want) to know about wool and polyester blends and start to wonder if another store has better options.   

How can you leave without hurting the rep’s feelings? 

It’s simple, you HIDE. 

Not physically, but verbally. 

You might recall yourself saying something like “I’m going to run to the bathroom, I’ll be right back” with absolutely zero intent to return. 

Maybe you’re more creative.. “ Well I left my kids in the car with the keys and my wallet, I’ll get back to you..”, or maybe you pull the infamous “family emergency” line. Either way, you’ve run for cover. 

And now for the final act, we STEAL. 

You just learned the every stitch to the sweater industry and you are headed to the competition, stealing all that knowledge and applying it as you shop around. 

You might bounce from brand to brand, soaking in every last detail, until you’re so sick of sweaters you decide to make one from scratch, or to scrap the whole idea. 

Don’t feel bad if you’ve engaged in any of this behavior, so have we, and it is OK. 

For those of us who are the sales representatives, national key account managers, and VP’s of global sales, etc., this is called the “run around”, and it stops now. 

Here are some simple steps to stop the buyer cycle:


## 1. Interrupt their thought pattern.

Remember the sales representative bee-lining toward you? 

Don’t be that rep., give the buyer space and wait till the right moment to ask them something they aren’t expecting. 

The shopper is prepared to lie to you as soon as you make contact, give them something to work with that they don’t need to lie about. 

A good interrupt will bring their defences down, help them relax, and open their minds.


## 2. Allow your prospects to exit the conversation.

People have a very hard time telling you “no”. 

It seems rude and their moral compass won’t allow them to, but not saying “no” forces them through the buyer’s cycle. 

Make sure you tell them that “no is Ok”, and get them to verbally agree to tell you if they feel that way. If they want to run, let them.

You should be looking for a “yes” or a “no”, those are acceptable answers, “I’ll get back to you” is not.

## 3.  Always be closing.

Well.. We have a different idea. 

Set your close at the very beginning of the conversation. 

Ask your prospect what they are looking for and make sure they are OK with the fact that you might not be able to help them. 

Tell them you want to see if you can help and if not, they are free to tell you it’s not a good fit, and visa-versa. 

At the end of the conversation, set aside a few minutes to discuss what to do next, whether you continue or they tell you “no”. 

This is probably old news to you. Most likely, you don’t experience the “run around” that often, but if you do, hopefully these tips will help. 

Stay tuned next week as we take a closer look at interrupting a prospect’s thought pattern. 

Until then, what is your idea of an interrupt? If you’re up for it, try it in your next selling situation.
