I'm sure we've all seen crazier things happen, but to date I've never met a high performing sales person that LOVES making cold calls. Whoever says they LOVE the actual task of making cold calls either is flat out lying or they don't do them. The thought of picking up the phone to call a stranger who you'll probably catch at a horrible time, get yelled at, told you're a horrible salesperson, say NO they would never take a meeting with you if they're company, family, and their life depended on it, and then hearing a dial tone is terrifying. The whole process can be very daunting and draining on a person if they allow their role to lead their identity instead of not allowing prospects to get under their skin. Everyone starts off being horrible phone prospectors and sound ridiculous, but the real difficult part is sticking with it and staying disciplined.

Thinking as a business owner, which most sales professionals are, the lifeblood of their successful company is based on revenue generation typically resulting from marketing and sales efforts. This success comes from constantly mastering your technique, keeping a forward thinking attitude, and love it or hate it- doing the necessary prospecting behaviors.
