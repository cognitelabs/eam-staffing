Ever since you were a small child, you were raised not to interrupt because it is rude. While that might be true, we are telling you that interrupting is essential for closing business. Let us explain:
 
It all starts with your five-year-old self, finally getting permission to answer the household landline (assuming that those reading this know what a landline is). Your parents likely told you that if you don’t recognize the voice on the other end, you have to ask who is calling, and check with your parents before handing the phone over. They were teaching you to become their gatekeeper and to screen calls coming from salespeople.
 
Every now and again, you would answer the phone, not recognize the voice, and the salesperson on the other end would ask to talk with your parents. It is in this moment you learned to lie to the salesperson. With your mom standing over your shoulder, you said, “I’m sorry, my mom can’t come to the phone right now, may I take a message?”.
 
From the very beginning we were trained how to avoid salespeople. It is as if our DNA tells us to [lie, hide, and steal from them](/blog/blog/lie-hide-steal-how-to-stop-the-run-around/). If you can interrupt this internal tape recording, you will bring your prospects guard down, and they will stop the recording.
 
What do you think a good Pattern Interrupt would be?
 
The funny thing is, you’re probably already using interrupts unintentionally. Now, let’s make it intentional. Here are some “interrupts” you might find helpful. Give them a try in your next selling environment:
 
## 1.  The Email
 
The best way to get your emails read is through a powerful subject line. If you’re writing a piece about the [resignation process](/blog/how-to-write-a-simple-letter-of-resignation) and you write in the subject line “How to Resign”, your email just got marked as “read” or swiped into the trash file. What if you tried “Please Accept My Letter of Resignation”? Most of us are naturally curious, we realize that this email wasn’t meant for us, but can’t we help but to open it to catch the office drama.
 
## 2.  Their Office
 
When you take a sales call in a prospect’s office it is easy to feel intimidated, you’re in their territory. Not only will the following interrupts stop their internal recordings, it will also give you some power back. Here are three simple interrupts to help you become more successful on their turf:
 
**Where in their office is the meeting held?**
 
When you get there, ask if you can move to a conference room, tell them you might want access to a whiteboard.  This gets the prospect out of their office, out of their big chair, and out of their comfort zone. It also allows you more freedom to be creative with step 2.

**Where do you sit?**

This seems trivial, but it is essential for bonding and rapport. The basic idea is to sit next to your prospect. This allows you to match and mirror better and creates a more collaborative environment. When someone sits on the other side of their desk, your internal tape recorder takes you back to the principal’s office and you begin to lose your power.

If you find yourself in their office, drag your chair over to their side of the desk or so you are diagonal to them. If you’re in a conference room, sit right beside them. If there is more than one person, try to sit between them or on an angle that prevents them from being directly across from you. Feeling invincible? Sit IN their chair.

**Do you take notes?**

This is one of the more simple interrupts if applied correctly. The trick is to ask them a question and in the middle of their response, interrupt them to ask to if you can write notes. This interrupt stops their prepared and guarded answer, and it also makes them feel as if their words are 
important.

## 3.  In Your Office

That is the interrupt. Make them come to you. This interrupt also brings better clients. Only those genuinely searching for help will drive across town to seek it.

## 4.  On the Phone

One of the best ways to keep prospects on the phone, whether it is a cold, warm, or nurturing call, is a small interrupt. Typically we say, “This is Jane Doe- Does my name sound familiar?” This immediately makes the prospect search their memory for how they might know you, stopping the internal recording. If the call is warm or nurturing, a simple “is now a good time?” will work just as well.

## 5.  Your Physical Appearance  

Not only are first impressions extremely important, but your clothing can be its own interrupt. If you are doing a cold walk-in, don’t wear your company’s polo. As soon as you walk through the doors, your decision maker will suddenly find his or herself “in a meeting”. Dress as a customer, peruse the merchandise, and think of your next interrupt for the unsuspecting sales representative walking over to you. Another option is to wear something that makes you stand out. This interrupt helps the prospect remember you and can also be a conversation starter.
 
The most important thing to remember with Pattern Interrupts is that you can have fun with them. Switch it up, try something new, and get creative. You’ll be amazed by the results.
