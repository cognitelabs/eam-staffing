In the last two months of my training I have had the pleasure of sitting in on several sales calls. For us, this means getting to know and understand the ins and outs of the companies we might want to work with, or who might want to work with us. These companies are typically run well, are growing, and are busy… and we’ve found that there can be a more effective way for both of us to have a purposeful conversation out of the gates.  At one point in our development, we decided to add homework as a first step between agreeing to meet, and meeting. Before we added this crucial step,  we found that precious time was spent covering the basics… Areas that we could get a much better handle on with a little bit of pre-work. We are happy to discover if our values fit yours, and to help you fully understand what we do, but we can streamline the process if we both come prepared. **We suggest meeting with your team to discuss these topics: time, effort and energy, money (budget), and if we’re both willing and able to do what needs to be done, to solve problems together.**

**TIME: Its important that our clients understand the time elements needed to work together in the most efficient way for both parties.  If time commitments aren’t defined before we start working together, they may end up becoming the roadblock to a successful partnership.**  We know you’re very busy and we want to save you time, but we need some as well. Some examples… When we send a candidate over, we need to make sure you have the time to interview them, the time to give us feedback from the interview,and the time for a weekly check in to ensure a glass door relationship. If you don’t see yourself being able to interview our candidate for a month, maybe this isn’t the right fit for both of us. That’s okay, like we said, we know you’re very busy!

**EFFORT & ENERGY** entail coordinating calendars for interviewing and feedback, getting the whole team involved, making sure there is time for our weekly meeting, and properly onboarding our candidate. In essence, making it happen. If you’re still hitting your goals without this new person, maybe this isn’t an immediate need, that’s alright, we understand. We know you have strong leadership and we just want to make sure everyone is on the same page. This step becomes incredibly important during the onboarding process. You probably already have a great onboarding strategy, but we can help you design and customize pay structure, compatible management tactics, and training to ensure our candidate’s success. 

**MONEY** can be a sensitive topic. Most people dance around budgets, we prefer to hit them head on. We don’t negotiate price, but we also dont want that to be the reason we dont do business together. We can work with you to merge how you pay your bills with our payments. Sometimes this process will help prospects discover they don’t need to add to the team, maybe the problem lies elsewhere. How much does finding the best sales or technical person mean to you, and how much you can spend to do so? What kind of ROI are you expecting if you spend $25K on finding this new person? Your company is most likely very successful, and if it doesn’t make sense financially to work together, that is OK. **We want to see you be successful, even if you don’t become a client.**

**Able and Willing, Willing and Able** can be issues on either end. Are you **able** to work with us? You might be willing, but can you make that decision, do you have the funding? Are you willing to work with us? Sometimes we come across companies that are able to work with us, but unwilling to do what we believe needs to be done to have a successful partnership.  Other times they are willing to do what we need to replicate success, but are just unable to do it now. Both are **_OK_**, we will only work with you if it’s what you truly want, and will happily bow out if you don’t.

EAM suggests these steps to help both parties discover our compatibility. Sometimes we find that a company will do their homework and realize that we aren’t right for them, before we ever meet. That is OK, you’re very busy, we don’t need to take time to meet if you know it won’t work out. On the flip side, if this sounds like the type of partner you’re looking for, there may be a reason to meet.
