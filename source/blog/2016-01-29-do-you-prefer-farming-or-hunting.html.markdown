Thinking as a high-level professional salesperson how would you explain what your profession is? Businessdictionary.com says the definition* of 'salesperson' is, "An individual who sells goods and services to other entities. The successfulness of a salesperson is usually measured by the amount of sales he or she is able to make during a given period and how good that person is in persuading individuals to make a purchase. If a salesperson is employed by a company, in some cases compensation can be decreased or increased based on the amount of goods or services sold."

Each month we conduct 100's of interviews with successful salespeople and consistently get let down when we find out they love sales, but would rather be given accounts to manage- large or small, and "sell" them more goods and services. This is important to a sales team, but how successful would it be if no one wanted to go hunt and generate new business relationships? This is a constant complaint we hear from our clients before working with them and what we've found is that it takes a lot of time, money, energy, and effort to navigate through the surplus of sales people looking for the more comfortable salary/smaller performance upside. Regardless, this is what we live for, and it's worth it all when we come across a high performing sales hunter that loves finding and closing new business.

As a sales staffing and executive search firm specializing in top sales talent we are fortunate enough to talk with and assist high performing sales professionals across many industry every day and love being in the position to offer better alternative opportunities whenever they're looking to make a move confidentially. If you're a business looking to grow your team and recruit top talent or a hungry sales hunter unhappy and looking for a better opportunity to knock it out of the park, contact our EAM team or visit [www.eamstaffing.com][1] to see if it's worth partnering up. Building benchmark sales teams is what we do.
