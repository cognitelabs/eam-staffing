People like working with people who are like themselves. It is easier to trust people who are wired similarly to you therefore easier to do business with them. While this might seem to be the best way to ensure office culture remains consistent and management remains effective and collaborative, different personalities bring huge value to your leadership team. Your team has already proven their strength and the power of their collaboration, but when your personalities are all so similar, details slip through the cracks. There are several different types of tests you can take to test your personalities; Myers Briggs, Devine, Organizational Engineering, Predictive Index (PI), DISC. Our favorite is DISC which represents: dominance, influence, steady, conscientious. We find that often times a leadership team embodies qualities from most of the categories of DISC, and that **learning how to understand one another’s personality and placing the missing character will positively affect productivity and profits.**

Let me explain further. Individuals can possess all of the traits of each DISC profile in different scenarios, but their **profile represents their natural self**. What they will naturally do in social scenarios, decision making, confrontation, etc. can all be predicted through DISC. This doesn’t mean that someone who is a _Dominant_ will never behave as a steady, **there are certain encounters and contexts will push people into other profiles**.

**Dominant** personalities tend to be quick in decision making, may be less patient, naturally assume leadership positions, and may come off as a bully.

**Influencers** are the social leaders. They are social butterflies, they excel at being approachable and trustable, but they get off track easily, and  may struggle to speak candidly.

**Steady** individuals are the loyal, team players. They are often approached for advice and they are very patient. On the flip side, they may fear and avoid change and confrontation.

**Conscientious** are typically our engineers and detail oriented people. They pay more attention to details and accuracy than most, and are motivated by opportunities to gain knowledge, but often fear being wrong and can have a hard time seeing the big picture.

Once your team is _tested_, the missing personality can be placed and potentially **maximize your team’s effectiveness**. Picture a room full of dominant personalities making shotgun decisions with the big picture in mind. Now imagine we place the conscientious individuals. This person is able to see all the detail in the immediate picture. They cross the T’s and dot the I’s. And vice versa, if everyone is looking at the trees, who will see the forest.

All personalities have pros and cons. **No personality is better than the other, which is important to keep in mind when you discover your own**. Once you understand your teammate’s personalities, you may be able to band together stronger. You’ll understand why their emails are blunt, why their overly sensitive to detail, why they struggle to stay on topic, and why they might seem like a pushover. This understanding is largely impactful on how effective your team can be.

Grasping your own personality traits is greatly important when trying to **improve personal success**. Clearly you’re doing an excellent job, you wouldn’t have made it as far as you have otherwise, but knowing when and how to tweak your strengths and weaknesses may unlock higher success rates. If you find you’re a _dominant_ and are having a difficult time being patient with long sales cycles, decision making processes, heck… even long lines, understanding why you are frustrated may help you see the _steady_ side of the situation. In kind, if you find yourself as _steady_ and having trouble with confrontation, understanding that road block can help you behave more _dominant_ in order to be heard.

Another gate unlocked by personality testing is **higher quality management**. Some managers find it takes a certain personality to fit the job. To some extent, yea.. That is true, some people “just get it”. In all actuality though, we have found that by mastering the traits of individual personalities, managers can tailor their behavior toward the specific needs of the individual. Yes, that takes a little more time, and in some cases, a lot more patience, but in the long run, **the entire team will begin to perform at a higher level**.

Hopefully, you are now curious as to where you fit on a personality test, and how you can improve your business by implementing them. They are incredibly important in understanding how your leadership team communicated, how to communicate with your subordinates, and how to improve yourself. We know you hire great employees, now imagine the benefits of hiring the **best** employees and having the right management to keep them.
