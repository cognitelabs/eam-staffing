Who keeps you on track? [@kenseawell](http://twitter.com/kenseawell) Twitter

We can’t predict the future, we can only hope it turns out positively. Accountability partners keep you on track when life tries to derail you. Partners usually range from a co-worker to someone you respect in your network. Their job is to keep you on task for your long run, professional, goals. The short term can be riddled with road bumps and discouraging moments making it easy to tweak your long term goal. We aren’t saying that you lower your standards, **but sometimes you get discouraged and start putting energy elsewhere**.  We interviewed Ken Seawell, Managing Partner at Sandler Training, Troy, Michigan to gain better insight into why these partners are so important.

**What would you say is the most important aspect in finding an accountability partner?**
“Trust- I think trust and conviction. You’re asking someone to spend time helping you grow. It can’t be one of those things where they only do it when they feel like it. "There has to be conviction, on both sides, committed to growth". And trust because you might hear and see things you weren’t expecting.” Ken says you have to be able to trust that they’ll tell you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear. “If you’re really going to be accountable to someone you need to be able to feel like you can say what you need, without judgement. You have to be willing to do what your partner helps you see you need to do. There’s no reason to be engaged in this process otherwise.”

**What kind of people do you recommend?**  
“I think it should be someone outside your personal scope where objectivity can remain consistent and clear. Not to say your significant other couldn’t do it, but it could be more uncomfortable for them.”

**Why do you recommend finding one?**  
“There’s a great difference between training and coaching. In training, I tell you what to do and you do it. When coaching, I help you see what you can do and you figure out how on your own.. Partners are more effective as coaches. I’m trying to help figure out why he’s not doing what he needs to do, I want him to recognize it and discover it for himself. In kind, he does the same for me.”

**Who is your partner/ where did you meet?**  
“Peter Schillingford- he was my first client here, at Sandler. He came with me to the Client Summit last year (the March Sandler Conference). After the Summit, he wanted to create the Accountability Partnership because he loved what he experienced. I’m starting a second one, but we haven’t coordinated it yet.”

**Do you recommend multiple accountability partners?**  
“Yes and no, you have to figure out what your partners are and what you’re trying to accomplish. Peter and I talk about how we grow our individual business, with this second person, who’s also part of the Sandler network, our accountabilities will be different. I’d say no, because you need to spend time working as well, it’s a juggling act. I don’t think more than two is necessary.”

**How often do you meet with Peter?**  
Ken suggests meeting twice a month and to schedule life around these meetings to help with consistency. “We meet twice a month. The first Thursday of every month is a 30 minute phone call and the fourth Thursday, we do breakfast.”

**How has your partner helped you?**  
“I think having partners allows you to remove some of the professional, trainer-student relationship, it allows you to address emotional things. It’s a good opportunity for us to see each other as people as opposed to student and teacher. It’s nice to not have to feel like I have to know it all every time, because I certainly don’t.”

**At what point in your career do you think you should get one?**  
“When, from a maturity standpoint, you think you can benefit getting information and giving information.  When you start your career, you might be mature enough to handle a partner, whereas someone ten years into it, might not be ready for those tough conversations. It’s about _maturity, conviction, and commitment_. There’s no time table for that”

Sometimes, we find that people already have an Accountability Partner, without knowing it. It’s someone they’ve always gone to for help but never specifically asked them to be their coach. If that is your case, just ask them to do it officially. Set your meetings in advance and schedule life around them. If you’re not this lucky, keep your eyes peeled for that special someone, they’re closer than you think.
