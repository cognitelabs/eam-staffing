![Elements of Perfect Cold Call](/images/blog/banner__perfect-prospecting-cold-call.png)

Cold calls are hard. A great script can make them much easier; but effective preparation can make them much, much easier.

Hate to burst any proverbial bubbles, but the perfect cold-calling script doesn't exist. However, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t better or worse approaches to the job. In our experience calling on thousands of prospects for dozens of clients, we’ve found the presence of five key elements can make or break a call.

## 1. Technique
The [right mindset of cold calling](/blog/3-mental-adjustments-for-a-more-successful-cold-call/) is paramount. However, a positive mindset without good technique isn't that effective. In our experience, best practice is to focus on pain, not features. In other words, we want to understand a customer’s “why” over and above our product’s “what.” There’s no sense in selling aspirin to someone without a headache, no matter how well it works.

If there’s no pain, there's no point in moving forward. Your job will be much harder if you try to convince someone you have a solution to a problem they don’t have to begin with.

When it comes to landing prospects, what we've discovered works best for us is a pretty simple technique: Deliver our company message in a 30-second "commercial" format that is pain-driven, rather than feature or benefit-driven, and seeks to figure out the prospect’s solvable pain points. If they exist, we set an appointment; if not, we move on.

In truth, if the message resonates, it often happens that they’re _eager_ to set the appointment.

## 2. Training and Measurement
Even more important than a great script is the training that happens prior to cold calling. Most of your time and energy should be spent here. However, measuring leading indicators – or elements you can control, such as number of dials and conversations – and how they are converting to appointments is also a key element to effective cold calling. If there is significant variation in rates between dials, conversations and appointments, there may be a coaching opportunity to ensure proper technique is being used, appropriate numbers of calls are being made, conversions captured, etc. 

Follow up is equally important. Many organizations provide salespeople some product training up front and then ‘let them go.’ After all, sales is often seen as an independent, “hunt or die” kind of job.

The best organizations, however, continually reinforce good prospecting practices such as ensuring the commercial is resonating, the prospect is being mirrored, and opportunities aren’t being squandered.

## 3. Tone
You have a much higher probability of creating a bond or rapport with your prospect during your necessarily brief interaction if you match or mirror their tone. Fast talker? Match their speed. Loud talker? Mirror their volume.

Sandler Training founder David Sandler notes that the key thing to remember is that [tone accounts for 38% of the effectiveness of your message](https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Teach-Ride-Bike-Seminar/dp/0071847820/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1493087035&sr=8-1&keywords=you+can%27t+teach+a+kid+to+ride+a+bike+at+a+seminar), while actual spoken words only account for 7%. Recording calls and playing them back can not only help with tone, but can also be used as an effective general training tool and to hone an ineffective script.

The other 55% of a message is attributable to body language. Although body language may not be visible over the phone, your comfort level can still translate. So sit forward, sit back, get up and walk around – whatever makes you, and thereby your prospect, most comfortable. 

## 4. Honest Control
Honesty can be very disarming, and let’s face it: everyone involved in the call knows you’re a salesperson, so let’s not pretend that you’re not. However, saying things like, “I’m probably catching you in the middle of something...” to begin a call versus, ‘Hi, how are you?” or trying to sound too familiar (like every other salesperson) can soften a prospect from the outset and increase your chances of continuing the conversation.

Acknowledge the reality of the relationship and everyone will be better off for it.

At the same time, you also want to give the prospect the feeling of being in control. This turns the conversation from one where you’re _pushing_ them towards your agenda to one where they’re _pulling_ you towards theirs.

Simple things like comments and questions such as, “It may not make sense for us to keep talking, but before we decide to hang up, do you mind if we take 30 seconds and then _you can decide_ where to take the call from there?” gets the prospect to make a decision, while you maintain the direction of the call. _You’re in control, but they feel like they’re driving._ 

This also helps avoiding the ["run around"](/blog/lie-hide-steal-how-to-stop-the-run-around/) that so many salespeople experience.

## 5. The Less You Know…
While it may seem counterintuitive: the less you know, the better. Remember, the point of the prospecting call is not to sell your product or service, but to _land a meeting_. When technical questions arise, that’s a great opportunity to suggest a face-to-face appointment rather than oversaturate them with details over the phone. The goal is to tee up the prospect in order to close them at a later date. 

To that end, make sure every call ends with very clear, defined next steps. Set a specific date, time and length for the meeting, and also let them know who will be involved and what the expected outcomes will be.

Cold calling is hard. But with effective training, tone, technique and a little up-front honesty, you’ll be well on your way to ensuring great conversations and a future full of closes.
