Change is scary. Leaving the security of a job and diving into the unknown isn’t for the faint of heart. Fortunately, you’re reading this because you’re a strong individual searching for the next step toward greatness. On average, Americans worked [1,790 hours in 2015](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS) and spent roughly 6,570 hours awake. This means the average American spends about 30% of a year at work. If you’re not in a job you love or believe in, then the job you’re in will feel like time wasted.

There are several signs that your current position is holding you back. Hopefully this article will give you the comfort of knowing you’re not the only one who experiences these feelings, and encourage you to find a job that is worth your 30%. Some of the most common signs are:

## Feeling Rejected & Voiceless 

Feeling rejected or powerless often comes from poor management. Micro-managing (which can be effective if done correctly) can be one of the many ways managers take away your power without knowing it. When micro-managing is done improperly, employees might feel they have no power or autonomy over their work. Another common issue: when a manager doesn’t believe in your department or project. Lack of managerial investment makes it nearly impossible to achieve your goals. Victims of this management style often feel underappreciated and perform poorly at work.

Hopefully you won’t have to experience either of these management styles, but if you do, you might want to look for employment elsewhere. Feeling undervalued and unheard will cause you to have low job satisfaction and lower your performance. Find a company that empowers you, invests in you, and listens to you.

## Poor Performance & Few Educational Opportunity

Poor performance is caused by a multitude of conditions. If your performance has been consistently low, there are a few things you can do to turn it around. First, ask your manager for help. Often times, a manager will help you work through problems. Second, look for [training programs and workshops](http://eamstaffing.com/blog/two-tips-to-goal-setting-that-increase-profit-and-performance/). You might just need some tweaking or a learn new skill set. Third, turn to peers for constructive criticism and new ideas for improvement. 

Management that is unwilling to help you improve isn’t worth 30% of your year. If they won’t invest in you, how can they expect you to invest in them? Sink or swim is a great idea, but most successful professionals know that you can’t make it to the top without help and training. Treading water for your entire career isn’t practical, occasionally you’ll need a buoy to lean on. 

## Obscure Pathways to Promotion

The best managers know that you probably don’t want to hold the same position forever. Typically, they will help you define a career path and keep you moving toward your long-term professional goals. Companies which lack a clear path for promotion are not well-suited to individuals who are looking to move up. 

If you’ve spoken with management about your desire to advance and you aren’t seeing a path to get there, it might be time to look for another opportunity. Whether it is in a different department or a different company, the current position will only hold you back.

## Inadequate Corporate Culture

At the end of the day, all of these negative feelings and emotions come from one core problem:  [corporate culture](http://eamstaffing.com/blog/how-to-develop-a-successful-high-performance-sales-culture/). If the culture isn’t a good fit for you, then you will not find the success you’re looking for. Every company is run differently, so once you’ve found the qualities you need, you can find the right one for you.
