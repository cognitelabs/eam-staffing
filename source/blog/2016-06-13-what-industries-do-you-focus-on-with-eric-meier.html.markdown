One of the most frequently asked questions recruiters receive is "what industry do you focus on?". While this question seems to be important toward the decision of which recruiting firm you choose, it is often not the case. Contrary to what several articles believe, industry specialization, or lack thereof, should not affect a recruiting firms ability to successfully place an individual. Typically, people ask this for two reasons, either they want to know if the recruiting firm has worked with competition or if we understand their industry. We interviewed Erik Meier, the Co-Founder/CEO of the EAM Staffing and President of Sandler Training, on why this is the case. 

Erik claims that this is a question he receives regularly. When asked how he normally responds, Erik explained that EAM Staffing works with well run organizations that are looking to expand their team and work with a recruiting firm, their industry does not matter. He said that this is the case because it is the reality of business.There has not yet been an industry that we have worked with where we have not successfully placed someone. If our industry experience is a priority in working together, companies may choose to work with us with the knowledge that we may not have that experience. 

When asked whether or not there is a consistent theme between industries that are concerned with EAMâ€™s experience, Erik pointed out that they may be looking at it from the wrong end. Usually it is an individual problem and industry trend has little to nothing to do with it. He equates it to trying to hit a golf ball from the head end of the iron. At the end of the day, it is what the individual is doing and practicing that determines the outcome, if it is a low season, increase you activities to make sales, etc.

Lastly we asked Erik if there is an important thing to know about every industry. His response, "engineers have specific skills, in any industry to be a professional you have to know how to be a successful and that comes through some level of training," and EAM, or any recruiting firm, can find the people with those skills whether or not they have experience in the industry.

Eam Staffing specializes in finding the best in-class sales and technological professionals. We are based in Troy, Mi with branches in Lansing, Mi and Boston, Ma.
