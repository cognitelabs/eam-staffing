Two months working at EAM Staffing I have learned, utilized and continually reinforced my sales techniques through thorough training taught by Sandler trainers and co-workers.  The more I sat through the classes I realized that the idea of sales surrounds us.  Whether it's the barista at Starbucks entertaining a new fall  drink or a Girl Scout selling cookies, the basic concept of sales is rooted within all of  our brains.  As a recruitment manager I hand select qualified candidates to be placed in various companies.  Not only do I have to sell myself over that first initial phone call, I revert back to the Sandler training system, consisting anywhere between how to communicate on the phone properly to narrowing down selected candidates, the sale is always at an arm lengths reach. What I like most about being a recruiter is the initial thrill of communication, that immediate connection that can lead anywhere.
