Every successful sales professional knows that the old ABC, or Always Be Closing, ideology of sales is long gone. Today's buyers are too refined for that mindset, and it usually just pushes them away. People want to buy, but they do not want to be sold. So how do you change this naturally resistant mindset? By creating and building relationships!

The most important part of any relationship is trust, and the quickest way to build that is simply by listening. Hear your prospects issues and concerns and only talk about the solutions that you can offer. Tell them about similar prospects and how you were able to help them out as well. A little bit of trust will go a long way, and a little might be all you need to get the ball rolling.

Another aspect of relationships is reliability. If you say that you will call or set an appointment, do it. Put it in your calendar and stick to it. Make follow up calls after major steps and see that the issues they presented to you are being solved. This will help with your credibility as well.

Finally, connect with the prospect after the sale is made and all the solutions have been delivered. Some sales cycles are longer than others but regardless of that, you've spent time and effort into building this relationship, do not let it slip through the cracks. They may have a new issue that wasn't revealed before or become a great referral partner allowing you to expand your business relationships and begin this cycle again and again.

The quicker you absorb this mindset, the more profound your client list will become. However, if you're stuck on anagrams then adapt the new ABC "Always Be Connecting" as coined by Jill Rowley. (_https://www.linkedin.com/in/jillrowley_)
