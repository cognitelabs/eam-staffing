![E-Card - Writting Sample Letter of Resignation](/images/blog/banner__sample-letter-of-resignation.png)

So you’ve realized that your job isn’t what you thought it was going to be, maybe it’s not the right fit, maybe they don’t have a [winning sales culture](/blog/how-to-develop-a-successful-high-performance-sales-culture.html), or maybe you have issues with management that can’t be resolved. That is OK. You’re not the only person to quit a job, but it is important to know how to do it appropriately. Here are the steps you need to write a simple letter of resignation.

## Step 1: Keep it short and to the point

You will have an entire exit interview to tell your employer why it didn’t work out. Now is not the time.
Address the letter to the individual who hired you or whomever the employee handbook suggests.
Tell them what position you’re resigning from and the date it is effective.
Common practice is to allow two weeks notice, but in some scenarios, more time can be appropriate.

We suggest giving more time than two weeks if you still have unfinished tasks, have made strong relationships with co-workers and need to end on a good note, and if you’re willing to help train your successor.

## Step 2: Acknowledge the opportunity

This is your chance to keep a positive relationship with your employer. It isn’t uncommon to find yourself working with some of these individuals at another company, so staying on good terms is important. This also leaves the opportunity for you to come back to this company in another position.

## Step 3: Lend a helping hand

If relations are in good standing when you choose to leave, or there isn’t pressure to move on quickly, it is highly recommended you offer to stay and help show the ropes to your replacement. In some circumstances this won’t be necessary, but if it can be done, it will help with keeping you in good standing with this company- should you ever need anything from them in the future.

Drafting the resignation letter should be the easy part. Breaking the news to your references, and mustering up the courage to enter your superior’s office and have this tough conversation

Here are two commonly used templates:
