It doesn’t take long to realize the professional world is a small one. Maintaining positive relations with coworkers is a must; one day they might be your supplier, the key to a new network, or worse.. Your boss.

These relationships grow through years of working together. Co-workers often become your friends, sometimes even close friends. Other times, your co-workers might be family which makes resigning even more complicated.

Because the relationships are delicate and often personal, it is essential to resign humbly from your position, to look to management for help, to talk to your reference in person, and to not settle with a company for the sake of family ties.

## Talk to Your Manager

You have probably been thinking about leaving for quite some time before you finally take action. In those weeks, months, even years, leading up to finally committing the act, you should be talking with your manager. This person is here to help you. They are supposed to:

- Make sure you have S.M.A.R.T. goals
- Give you the resources for learning and growth
- Support you when times are tough

Talk to them, figure out if there is any way they can help. If so, give their solution a chance. Maybe it’ll work out. Chances are they don’t want you to leave.

## Face to Face - Preserve Professional Relationships & References

In this day and age, most people have a reference within a company that helps them get a job there. If this is the case for you, remember that your reference put their neck on the line to help get you an interview. You were supposed to make them look good, and now you’re leaving. This person **needs to hear the news first and in person***. If you’re up for it, ask this person for help fixing whatever it is that is pushing you out the door. This is always important, but even more so if the [job you’re leaving is a new one](/blog/damage-control-quitting-a-new-job.html).

Reaching out to this person  will show them that they were not wrong about your character or your ability, you just were not a good fit for their company. That is OK, and they’ll see it that way too.

## Dont Settle

Now days it’s seemingly impossible to get your dream job without having a high reference within a company. Most often this person is:

- A family member
- A significant other’s family member
- And sometimes your significant other

This can make leaving incredibly difficult. Dont settle for a job that isn’t working in hopes to preserve these relationships.


If they have a personal relationship with you, they are more than likely to understand why you need to move on. These individuals want to see you be happy and successful, even if it’s an unfortunate turn of events.


Resigning is never easy, someone will always feel burned. Hopefully, if you follow these guidelines, the burn will heal quicker. These conversations will be tough, and they will require bravery and trust. In the end these acts will preserve your character, morals, and relationships, personal and professional.
