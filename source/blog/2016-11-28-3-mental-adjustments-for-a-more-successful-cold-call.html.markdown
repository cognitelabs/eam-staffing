If someone ever tells you they “love” cold calling they either don’t do it or they are doing it wrong. Very few people can handle getting rejected repeated, all day, 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year. While making these calls may send even the strongest individuals into an emotional whirlwind, there are a few ways to ease the pain of rejection.


## 1. Come from abundance

Often it can seem like no one wants your product or service. We tend to jump to conclusions, forecasting negative outcomes, and assuming we know what is going on inside a prospect’s mind.

The truth is, we aren’t mind readers, there is no possible way that we can forecast how every single call will go. We have to learn to break the cycle and in order to do so, we need to understand and believe we are coming from abundance. Let’s break it down even further.. 

- There are roughly 6 million  companies in the united states. [source](*http://avondaleassetmanagement.blogspot.com/2012/05/number-of-companies-in-us.html)
- These 6 million companies are home to roughly 114 million employees. [source](*http://avondaleassetmanagement.blogspot.com/2012/05/number-of-companies-in-us.html)

Let’s now assume you contact 1 employee per company making 500 cold calls per week. Let’s also assume you don’t take holidays off, it will take you 231 years to contact every company in the US.

Let those numbers sink in. Maybe you have a niche industry and you’re calling on select people, good sales practice says you should be in touch with at least three people within an organization. That dramatically increases the number of touches you’re making and your abundance.

Once you trust that you’re calling from abundance, hearing “no”, among other profanities, is not such a big deal after all. Now you have 5,999,999 more calls to make. 
    
## 2. Be open to feedback

A large factor to success in cold calling is allowing others to help you. Whether it is your manager in a weekly meeting or the person next to you in the office, feedback is key. 

Take time after a rough call to dissect it, what could you have done better? What were some flinch moments? How will you be better prepared in the future?

More importantly, dissect the successful calls. Why were you successful? What were you thinking going into the call? What was different?

Sometimes when we stop selling, they start buying. Maybe you have to give up the seller mindset and make the call with the idea that your product might genuinely help. Remember, reaching a “no” is OK, at least a decision was made. 

## 3. Find an Accountability Partner

We’ve touched on the importance of accountability partners before, but they can really come in handy in a cold calling environment. 

This person makes sure you’re reaching your weekly activity goals. They are here to lightly nudge you above and beyond your goals because they know that activity determines sales. 

Accountability partners are also essential for feedback. This is someone that you can trust to give you hard truths when necessary, to hold your hand, and to celebrate the wins with. 

No one makes it to the top without help, intellectual humility, and the correct mindset.
