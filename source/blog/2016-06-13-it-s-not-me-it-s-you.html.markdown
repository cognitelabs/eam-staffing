## Signs and symptoms your company is not the right fit for you

Have you ever found yourself wanting to avoid work or tasks, not feeling inspired about your job, or experiencing frustration at work?

There is a good chance you’re suffering from job dissatisfaction. 

Job satisfaction drives job performance. Low job satisfaction can be caused by several different issues within your company. We have been able to narrow down the most common signs and symptoms people experience when they are not satisfied at their current positions.  Some of the reasons are clear, while others may be subtle. 

The most common problems driving the signs and symptoms of poor job fit are 

1. ineffective management
2. lack of investment in the employee, and an 
3. incompatible office culture. 

When employees are constantly given negative feedback, it diminishes their confidence in their ability to complete tasks and do jobs right. It creates anxiety within a worker that makes even the simplest of tasks seem challenging.  When these feelings arise within someone they begin to lose interest in their work and the only incentive that is left is the paycheck at the end of the month.  

Once people begin working only for the money and dread to going to work for it, they begin to perform at the bare minimum.  Unfortunately, employees can be afraid to leave these jobs because they are a safety net, but at the end of the day it is more important to actively pursue a job with a company that will give you the respect you deserve.

Avoiding going to work and performing contractual tasks is also a symptom of lack of motivation. This can come from a manager who assigns vague tasks, too many tasks, or unachievable goals. Motivation is the manager’s job to tap into. A good manager will figure out what makes their employees tick, they will figure out specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely goals that are in line with the company and also tie into what makes their employee want to earn that next paycheck. When a manager figures out what tools to use to help motivate individual employees, there should not be role ambiguity, task overload, or unattainable goals. Lack of motivation is a major red flag when it comes to poor management. Other symptoms of poor management that lead to a lack of motivation include, consistently poor feedback with no measures taken to help improve, unclear path of advancement, and an increased workload with no increase in incentive.

A major investment in employees, is training. This is where the foundation of a career is set and where tools are received to be successful with the company. If employees do not receive this investment, their performance may be suffering, they may experience frustration toward their management, and their goals will feel unattainable. A good company will send its workers to training during an off season, after a poor performance review, and make them available to take from free will. Training should expand upon strengths, making them even stronger, and it should also round up weaknesses. It should increase confidence and job knowledge, helping individuals feel more fulfilled with their position.

Lastly, the company culture is important for moral and motivation. Being able to be yourself and comfortable around co workers should be a priority in evaluating job satisfaction. Reaching out to a staffing services will shows individuals that there are companies that have a culture more aligned with their own. Beginning the search is always the hardest part, but a good recruiter company is able to quickly help unhappy employees realize that there are many other options that will  fit their goals and culture.  

A positive attitude at the beginning of your day and a burn out by lunch may mean that corporate culture, poor management, or lack of investment are taking place. An organization that is a good fit will be a place you are proud of. You will look forward to going to work, to sharing your experience, and you will progress in your own time. If any of these symptoms are relevant to you, it is encouraged that you begin looking elsewhere for employment.
