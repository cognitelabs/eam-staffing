## Signs and symptoms your company is not the right fit for you

Have you ever found yourself wanting to avoid work or tasks, not feeling inspired about your job, or experiencing frustration at work? 

There is a good chance you’re suffering from job dissatisfaction. 

Low job satisfaction can be caused by several different issues within your company. We have been able to narrow down the most common signs and symptoms people experience when they are not satisfied at their current positions.  Some of the causes are clear, while others may be subtle. The most common sources of the signs and symptoms of poor job fit are, ineffective management, lack of investment in the employee, and an incompatible office culture. 

Avoiding going to work and performing contractual tasks is a symptom of lack of motivation. This can come from a manager who assigns vague tasks, too many tasks, or unachievable goals.

Motivation is the manager’s job to tap into. A good manager will figure out what makes their employees tick, they will figure out specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely goals that are in line with the company and also tie into what makes their employee want to earn that next paycheck. When a manager figures out what tools to use to help motivate individual employees, there should not be role ambiguity, task overload, or unattainable goals.

Lack of motivation is a strong symptom of poor management. Other symptoms of poor management that lead to a lack of motivation include, consistently poor feedback with no measures taken to help improve, unclear path of advancement, and an increased workload with no increase in incentive.

Companies with an extensive training program are investing in their employees. This is where the foundation of a career is set and where tools are received to be successful with the company. If employees do not receive this investment, their performance may be suffering, they may experience frustration toward management, and their goals may feel unattainable. A good company will send its workers to training during an off season, after a poor performance review, and make them available to take from free will. Training should expand upon strengths, making them even stronger, and it should also round up weaknesses. It should increase confidence and job knowledge, helping individuals feel more fulfilled with their position. 

Lastly, the company culture is important for moral and motivation. Being able to be yourself and comfortable around co workers should be a priority in evaluating job satisfaction. Reaching out to a staffing services will show individuals that there are companies that have a culture more aligned with their own. Whether your ideal culture is a cubical atmosphere, or an open floor with ping pong and other games, the right culture should be a priority in your search. Beginning the search is always the hardest part, but a good recruiting company is able to quickly help unhappy employees realize that there are many other options that will fit their goals and culture.
