Networking events can be an intimidating place. Though they are meant to facilitate conversation, many people feel nervous before hand. Sometimes people feel this way because they don’t know anyone attending, they’ve never been to one, they’re generally more quiet people and social settings make them anxious, etc. If this describes you, don’t worry, you’re not alone. We interviewed Marc Yesh, Director of Recruitment for Salefish Search Group, a partner with EAM Staffing, and founder of Massachusetts Recruiter Connection, to find out how to be more effective in networking scenarios. 

Here are some tips and tricks to help you exchange cards, talk to the right people, and how to be remembered. 

## Timing
Marc suggests showing up a little early. Often times, there is a networking period before the presentation starts, if you show up before everyone, you can talk to the organizers. He says that the “organizers can give you insight as to who will be attending the meetings. You can ask them about what kind of events they’ve had in the past, what they expect for today, and what they’re going to do in the future to get a better grasp on the group.” Marc also says that leaving is situational. If it isn’t a helpful event to you, you could stick around for referrals, but that could be a waste of time. If it is helpful to you, stay till the end. Talk to as many people as possible.

## Exchanging Business Cards

1.  Decide on a minimum number of unique conversations to have at this event 
and a minimum number of meetings to walk away with. Marc recommends three or more depending on the size of the event.  “_At smaller events, Limit the number of cards taken in, be more exclusive. This number system gives you a goal and purpose for the event_”.
2.  Put notes on the back of your new cards. Why did you exchange cards? Why was this person significant? This will help you remember to follow up with people that you might not have been able to set appointments with and also allows you to work through the “stack” of cards clogging your desk.

## Identify People Who May Not be Valuable to You  

There are three great questions to ask people you’ve just met in order to learn if they are worth talking too and if they might have a connection for you.
1.  How did you get to where you are now?
2.  What are you working on that is new and exciting?
3.  Where do you see yourself in five years?

If there is a connection then continue to talk and learn more. When the conversation winds down, set an appointment with the individual to continue talking about their needs. That could sound something like, “I don’t want to take up too much of our time, we are here to network. Is there a time, in the near future, where you’d like to get together and continue this conversation?”.

If you realize this person may not have what you need, the best technique to part ways is to thank them for sharing and offer to look out for people who may need their service. Ask them to do the same, in kind, and part ways. Now you’re both free to work the room and potentially help one another.

## How to Stand Out:
1.  Schedule appointments right then in there. DON’T get a card and move on if there was a need for the two of you to talk.
2.  Think of a good pattern interrupt. People are proud of what they do , ask them something about themselves. Tell them you don’t know anyone at this event and be curious about them. Be disarmingly honest, ask for help, people love to help.
3.  Follow up with people. You have their information, tell them how great it was to meet them and confirm appointments you set at the event.
4.  When parting ways with people, if you found a common interest, tie it back into the conversation before it’s over. Or remind them of what you discussed and why you set that appointment.
 
You’re probably doing most of these already, but in case you haven’t, we are hoping that these tips help you get the most out of your networking experience. Setting numerical goals for these events allows you to work toward something specific, this is especially helpful if networking gives you any form of nervousness or anxiety.
