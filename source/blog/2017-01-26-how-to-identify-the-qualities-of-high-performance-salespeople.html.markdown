Sales positions are among one of the toughest positions to fill. Oftentimes salespeople are very good at selling themselves in an interview but once the dust has settled, they aren’t performing well enough. In other occasions, the talent is there but the attitude or characteristics aren’t compatible with the company’s culture. In either scenario, the company is wasting time and money losing this employee, looking for the replacement, and training the new salesperson, only to have them leave within a couple months. 

According to the United States Census Bureau there are [roughly 14.6M sales professionals](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk) in the United States alone. So how do you know when you have a top performer?

## Quantify

First and foremost, the candidate needs to be able to back themselves up with hard earned numbers. While sales positions might be the hardest to fill, they are the easiest to quantify. Most companies are looking for star performers so this candidate should have stellar numbers. They should always be surpassing their sales quotas.

## Skill

As noted in [last weeks article](/blog/how-to-recruit-the-best-salespeople-in-the-world/) these are qualities that can be taught. When a company creates its open position, they will write a list of desired skills needed to carry out the day to day activities. Idyllically, the top candidate will have all of the skills needed, but since no one is perfect, the hiring manager may need to settle for the candidate with the most relevant skills. They can teach the new hire the rest.

Organization, timeliness, and resourcefulness are easy skills to spot. Questions like:

1. Tell us a time where you had to manage more accounts than usual and how did you reach all your goals?
2. Was there ever a time where you didn’t know how to do a task or answer a question and how did you solve that problem?

Though these questions are simple they help separate the strong candidates from the weak. If a candidate answers question 1 with an answer that insinuates that they wait until the last second and work overtime to complete their tasks, they probably don’t possess timeliness or organization.  

## Traits

Arguably the most important part of the salesperson’s makeup, traits are the qualities that cannot be taught. These are much harder to detect and just as easy for the candidate to lead the manager astray. 

**Self starting** people are more successful in sales roles that aren’t based in an office environment. It is important for the candidate to wake up in the morning and get to it, without a nudge from management. These are the people who don’t need their mom to wake them up in the morning.  Self starters are problem solvers, they think critically, and are team players. 

1. Does the candidate have any side projects they’re working on? Do they have any hobbies?
2. Can you tell us what your average day looks like?

The answer to question two can tell the hiring manager more than whether or not they are a self starter. If the candidate breaks down their day backwards, hourly, and with high detail, this person is probably very organized, timely, and a self starter.

**Conscientious** people can’t leave anything unfinished. They are very organized and have a high level of self control. These people have a hold themselves to a high level of responsibility and they believe in appearances. This trait is arguably the most important in salesperson because it embodies many skills and other traits. 

**Competitiveness** is largely important in finding the best salespeople. They need to be driven to win, to beat others, and to want to beat their personal best scores as well. Competition will drive this person to be better in every aspect. 
Do/did you play any sports?
How do you react when you aren’t at the top of the leader board?
How do you feel when someone gets more praise than you on something you’re both working toward?

**Attitude** should be considered when choosing between candidates. Maybe your candidate has all the desired skills, and they’re competitive and self starting, but they don’t handle being last with grace or they’re short wicked. What if they don’t handle rejection well and it takes them a while to bounce back? Salespeople need to be naturally positive people. This job requires hearing “no” repeatedly everyday and not many people can stomach that much rejection. 

At the end of the day, salespeople are people too. They’re dynamic and changing, they have their own feelings and habits. It is the hiring manager’s job to find the best possible combination of skills and traits from their pool of candidates. 

Hopefully, with the help of great hiring managers, the stereotypical salesperson will move away from the used car guy and toward the leaders of our companies and economy.
