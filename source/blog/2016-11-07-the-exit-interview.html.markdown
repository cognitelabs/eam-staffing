![Exit Interview Quote - EAM Staffing](/images/blog/banner__exit-interview.jpg)

“Saying” is often easier than “doing”. You’ve dreamt about this moment for a long time, you’ve submitted you letter of resignation, and now you are about to accomplish the last step, the exit interview. While you might be anxious, maybe even nervous, there’s a silver lining- the hardest part is already over.  You’ve submitted your letter. You’re free. All you have to do now is answer a few quick questions in the exit interview.

The toughest part of this last step is keeping yourself together and giving constructive feedback. Here are some key points to remember as your exit interview gets closer.

## Vent before, not during

You may have some choice words you’d like to share with management. Maybe there is a co-worker or two that need a reality check. You should release any pent up emotions, but not in the exit interview.

You still need to behave like a professional. Don’t burn bridges with these people, they might be important in the future.

## Give constructive criticism, not destructive

HR will be present in this interview. They are recording everything that’s being said. Being destructive will create extensive paperwork for everyone involved and last we checked you’ve been ready to leave for quite some time.

If you’re leaving because of a sensitive situation, bad relations, misconduct, or unresolvable conflict, use your best judgment. When the interviewer or HR asks why you’re leaving, tell them the issue has been resolved (if that’s true), there’s no sense in beating the conversation to death.

## Let your voice be heard

Stay positive, this will allow you to give more constructive feedback, but it will also help them hear you. If you check your emotions and negativity at the door your interviewer will be more inclined to respect your ideas.

Be professional. Treat this exit as if it were an interview to get a new job. Tell them how or where they need work.

- Salary
- Benefits
- Corporate culture

Voice these concerns with respect to the company. You want to promote a positive change so that your predecessor can be successful.

## Be Brave

These conversations are tough. It’s easier to continue to put off your departure, you have so much at stake. Be brave, take a deep breath, count to ten, and walk into your managers office. Once you start talking, you’ll immediately relax.

During your exit interview it will feel easier to be dramatic and tell the company how you really feel. Instead, be brave. Help them succeed, save face, and leave a positive legacy.
