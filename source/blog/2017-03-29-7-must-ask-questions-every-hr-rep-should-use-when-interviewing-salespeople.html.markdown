So, you're looking for [that perfect sales rep](/blog/how-to-identify-the-qualities-of-high-performance-salespeople/). You know the one; they hit their numbers 100% of the time, they take criticism well and use it, hold themselves accountable, inspire others to raise the bar, and they hit the ground running every morning, ready to take on the day. 

But how do you find those people? 

How do you weed out the individual that is not only a motivated and successful sales professional but also the best fit for the company that is looking to hire them? 

Start with these 7 questions.  

## Question 1: Bucket the Candidate
*The question: How often do you hit or exceed quota/prospecting goals?*

This is a great place to start because it helps put that candidate into one of three of categories.

The first category is the ~20% of reps that never hit their goals and only make excuses. 

You can quickly recognize someone in this group because they will immediately begin making excuses as to why they don't hit their goals. 

They pass the blame, and it's hard to envision them ever being at the top. 

The next, much larger group, are the roughly 60% of candidates, who hit their goals a lot, but sometimes don't. 

They won't pass the blame and are more likely to recognize their weaknesses. This group is happy to exceed that lower 20%, and they offer an opportunity for coaching.

Then there's the top ~20% of candidates that always hit their mark and even exceed it. 

When you meet these candidates, it's a no-brainer. 

While these percentages are merely rough estimations based on our experience, the truth remains that identifying which category a candidate is helps to quantify the gap between where they are, where you want them to be, and how much time, effort and money it will take to close the gap between the two. 

## Question 2: Determine What the Candidate is Used To
*The question: Do you prefer longer or shorter selling cycles? Describe the steps and timelines you take from prospecting to close.*

In any interview, you're trying to figure out the reasons this person may not be a good fit for your client. This question could reveal one of those reasons. 

When you ask this question, you're not focusing on the time it takes them to close a sale, you're focusing on how they manage that time and the time frames they are accustomed to. 

You need to know what they perceive as long and short and how that fits in with your organization. 

Take the difference between selling a Boeing airplane versus off-the-shelf software. One will necessarily take longer to sell than the other.

A rep used to long sales cycles isn't a bad sales person; they're just not likely going to be a constant prospector. 

Conversely, reps used to 10 or 30 day closes might not have the stamina for a longer sales cycle.

Every business has different needs, and this question will show if they're a good fit for your processes.

## Question 3: Determine How the Candidate Handles Failure
*The question: Give me an example of a time you lost a client. What would you have done differently and what did you learn?*

By asking this question, you're not looking for someone who never makes mistakes. 

We all do, and sales isn't an easy job. 

You're looking for someone who can handle failure. This question will reveal how they handle mistakes and how they deal with failure. Do they point fingers and blame or others? Or adjust, learn and move on? 

## Question 4: Determine Decision-Making Processes
*The question: Let's pretend you get an offer from our company, you also get another one from a different company, and then your current manager makes you an offer to stay. How do you decide which path to take? Who else do you consult with before saying y/n?*

This question may seem loaded and a bit verbose but there's a lot of action and a lot of pressure, and that's a good thing. 

You'll get a lot of different answers that reveal different things about the candidate. 

By finding out how they make decisions and what they base those decisions on, you can get a little peek at their lives and the centers of influence in their lives. 

If they absolutely won't return to their current employer, you may begin to see why they left and their commitment to, and passion for, your opportunity. You can start to paint a picture of their lives and get a look at aspects you may not be able to ask about but obviously play a big part in their decision-making process. 

## Question 5: How they Like to Be Managed
*The question: What type of management style do you like? What don't you like?*

Most people hate micromanagement. But, that phrase means something different to everyone you interview. 

This questions will show how much hand-holding they like or require, their ability to get up to speed quickly and feel comfortable on their own.

It also gives them an opportunity to vent. And, when they start to vent, it may reveal past frustrations with management and management styles. 

A lot of top-performers don't mind putting in their numbers and being tracked, but it's often those that show up in that low-performing group we mentioned earlier that may have a problem with being held accountable or "overly" managed. This often opens up the opportunity for more specific questions about performance and situations. 

## Question 6: Rejection
*The question: How do you handle all of the rejection while prospecting?*
 
Everyone is motivated by different things. Everyone has a few key drivers that, even on their worst days, get them out of bed in the morning and keep them going. So, when they have a bad day, and they just can't seem to get moving, what's going to push them? And, are those motivators present in the position you are offering? If not, it may not be the right fit no matter how qualified the candidate is. 

## Question 7: Uncover Hidden Drivers
*The question: What obstacle could you imagine coming up over the next year or two that would get in the way of you being successful?*

It's been said, "If there's a bomb in the room, light the fuse and blow it up." If there's a problem, or might be down the road, it's best to identify and address it as soon as possible rather than waiting until it's too late. 

This puts those problems out in the open. 

## Expect it to be Hard
One of the most challenging things about interviewing candidates is sussing out when they're telling you the complete truth or just what you want to hear.

This challenge can be compounded when you’re feeling pressure from management to ‘just get someone in here.’

Still, in the world of sales, it’s better to take your time and screen hard to find the right candidate. 

This may come as a surprise, but most sales candidates are aiming to present themselves the way they want to be perceived. Which may not be who they are.

And, unfortunately, the cost of hiring the wrong person is much greater than the risk of passing on the right person.

Because most of the answers to the questions we've offered are going to be surface-level answers, it may be worthwhile to involve a sales staffing team who knows how to move beyond the surface and qualify the candidate. 

Still, ask these questions and you'll be on your way to identifying, qualifying, and hiring better sales talent.
