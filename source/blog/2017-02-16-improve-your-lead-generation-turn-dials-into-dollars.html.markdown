Anyone can pick up a phone and make a cold call. Anyone can generate sales from cold calling. The big question is, how do you become an effective and prosperous Business Development Representative? We have touched on the [skills and traits](/blog/how-to-identify-the-qualities-of-high-performance-salespeople/) required to be profitable in a selling environment and a few tricks to keep the right [mindset](/blog/3-mental-adjustments-for-a-more-successful-cold-call/) in the past. Now let’s talk about what is required of a sales professional to actually make dollars from dials. 

## Company Culture & Experience

First and foremost, your [company’s culture](/blog/how-to-develop-a-successful-high-performance-sales-culture/) impacts success and profitability. If the culture isn’t right, the sales team will reflect it immediately. The atmosphere needs to be supportive, open, and competitive. 

When someone on the team is feeling inadequate, the team is responsible for helping lift them back up. Maybe a teammate closes a deal and receives immediate gratification through praise from their peers. Similarly, if a teammate falls below their minimum acceptable behaviors or quotas, team members can acknowledge their struggles and offer to help. 

It is imperative that salespeople feel comfortable with their team. This trust comes from a culture that empowers them and is empathetic, yet assertive.

Maybe you’ve joined a team and you are bringing in ten plus years of calling experience. You’re ahead of the curve and will probably experience success much quicker than some of your greener teammates. Or, maybe this is your first sales job and you’ve never called a stranger before, let alone try to make money. That is okay. If you can handle it, you’ll be great. 

No matter how much prior experience you have, exposure is the basis of effective cold calling. If you’re not making the calls while you’re training and receiving feedback, you won’t improve. It’s that simple. The end goal is to make fewer calls leading to more sales. For beginners, let’s start with weekly call goals along with simultaneous, ongoing training. 

## Intellectual Humility & a Desire to Learn 

When it comes to developing your cold calling skills, sitting through training and then pounding the phones will not be enough. That is the equivalent of going to the gym for an hour, and then eating potato chips and cake right after. 

[Intellectual humility](/blog/nobody-likes-a-suck-up/) means asking for help and acknowledging when you don’t know the answer. If your calls have been plateauing, do you continue on with no change? Or do you ask someone to listen-in and help guide your calls toward better outcomes? You should feel comfortable asking for help and leaning on your peers and managers. Your success is their success.

A desire to learn is not something that can be taught. You need to actively participate in your training sessions by:

1. Asking questions, 
2. Taking notes, 
3. Role playing,
4. And analyzing past positive or negative selling situations.

Seeking help ties into a desire to learn and grow your talents. Seeking extra training will also improve your effectiveness. 

## Optimism & Confidence

At the end of the day, optimistic people are the last ones standing, in every city, every job, and every industry. This might be one of the most (if not the most) important traits of a successful Business Development Representative. Without it there is no drive to keep calling, rejection after rejection. There is no desire to learn or become better. If you’re not an optimistic person, you probably wouldn’t be reading this blog about improvement. 

Typically, when you’re cold calling a business, you’re trying to get ahold of a CXO or a decision maker. This means you’re talking to people who make more money than you, would be your boss, and hold all the power. It can be very intimidating and difficult, mentally, to get them to hear you because of their perceived power. 

Confidence is key in these scenarios because the person receiving your call doesn’t know anything about you. If you come off as nervous and weak, your prospect will take control of the call and end it. If you talk to your prospect like an [equal](/blog/have-you-established-equal-business-stature/) and are able to move past their title, they will give you their invaluable time. 

Cold calling is one of the hardest aspects of a professional seller’s job. To master prospecting takes years of experience, training, and innate business acumen. It might feel impossible, but perseverance and a positive attitude will pay off greatly in the long run. Stick with it and watch your dials turn to dollars.
