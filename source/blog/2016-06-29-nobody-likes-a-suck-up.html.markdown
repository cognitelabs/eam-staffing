## No One Likes a Suck Up, Don’t Be a “Yes Man”

The worst way to land your dream job is to people please your way in. 

People like doing business with people like them or people they like. This doesn’t mean go into an interview with a bad attitude, but certainly don’t pretend you LOVE doing stuff you hate. Just because you have always wanted to work for a certain company, does not mean you should ignore your gut and “yes” your way in. 

Disqualify companies, look for reasons why it might not be a good fit for you in 1-2 years; get to the “no’s” fast until you find a company that is obviously the "Yes!" 

Even if that means letting that dream company go. 

Approach a new career opportunity with an "Equal Business Stature" mindset, find your core values, and _stick to them_. 

EAM has a very specific set of core values that we live by, whether it’s in a work environment, at home, or a social setting.

## Disqualify Hard, “No” is Ok
Your job search should have two outcomes, "no" and "yes". 

Define what the components are to disqualify a company as well as qualify. Don’t force a “maybe” gut feeling into a yes. Look for “no’s” and remember to come from abundance rather than scarcity. There are so many potential places to work and you can’t possibly be a perfect match for all of them; certainly not most.

## Be Original and Authentic

Stop trying to fit other people’s expectations. 

Stand out, be yourself. 

When companies interview tens or hundreds of people, they are seeing a majority that all fit the same mold. Break the mold, dress in your style and change your resume to stand out, etc. These are simple ways to be a bright yellow suit in a room of navy and black. Employers will remember you, you took a risk, you broke the mold, you came in with a different perspective.

## Be Disarmingly Honest, Stop Selling

Acknowledge where you failed, what you did wrong, why, and use that to figure out if you shouldn’t work with a company. Tell your interviewers that you don’t have that one experience and use that as a chance to get clarity for whether or not having that experience is an interview stopper. 

Refrain from saying you have “a little” experience when, in reality, you don’t. 

This will help both parties figure out if training is necessary, or if you can get to a “no”.

## Have a High Level of Intellectual Humility

Tying into the previous value, use your weaknesses as strengths. Rather than sweeping them under the rug, learn from them.

Most people don’t realize that their weaknesses can be a strength if you’re willing to learn from them and own them. "Fail early and fail often" is another one of our values that supports the idea of intellectual growth through failure and the willingness to learn. 

Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, frequently talks about learning from his failures, and how many he has had:

> “I’ve made billions of dollars of failures at Amazon.com. Literally, billions. ...”
>  
> - Jeff Bezos

If you can successfully find your own set of values that improve your self carriage and self worth, the dream job will find you. 

Acknowledge your mistakes and learn from them, look for reasons you won’t be a good fit, be disarmingly honest, and be original.
