Networking is not only one of the best tools for business development, it can also be used for personal and professional success. Face to face is the best way to get referrals and do business, but these events also help you learn new trade technology and strategies. Another common use for networking is to aid your job search, meeting an employer at an event will help you stand out much more than sending your resume in. We interviewed Marc Yesh, Director of Recruitment for Salefish Search Group, a partner with EAM Staffing, and founder of Massachusetts Recruiter Connection, to find out just how important networking is and some tips to do it successfully.

**Q: Do you recommend networking to all professionals? Why?**  

“Yes, professionals and non-professionals alike. There are groups and conventions for every industry. There are two aspects to networking: Expand your knowledge of the business, and connecting with others to learn and grow from others successes and failures. These groups help you pick up on the ever changing technology/ techniques/ markets which expands your knowledge of the industry.”

**Q: In your experience, how has networking helped you in  business/ life?**  

“Professionally, as recruiters, one of the biggest way we find candidates is through referrals. The personal face to face really helps get a sense of personality and character. Making it easier to refer or recommend. Personally, growth, you meet people who have new insights and they can help you find new techniques or technology you haven’t tried yet. Networking also can be used to help you find a mentor or accountability partner.” 

**Q: What types of networking groups do you recommend most often?**

Marc said that there are two main types, industry specific and organized groups. Typically the industry specific groups allow you to attend one free meeting to get a feel for the group where organized groups hold small sample meetings. His favorite are conventions and after hour events. He cautions that conventions are usually full of people looking to sell, so only go to those if you want to buy or be connected with a company’s distributor, supplier, etc.

**Q: Was there ever a time when networking was the sole reason something important happened?**
            
“I went to a multi-chamber networking event, it was a good group of people. I went with my goal of twelve unique conversations and three face to face meetings for a later date. I met someone in in charge of Student Engagement at one of the local colleges. Through our conversation we set up an appointment to meet in a couple days. When I followed up, our discussion lead me to being an approved speaker for their career services. This opened a new resource and pipeline for my company. That kind of connection doesn’t happen on the phone or through an email, it happens in face to face settings. If I hadn’t walked up to this individual and introduced myself, I wouldn’t have gotten this opportunity.”

**Q: You recently started your own networking group, what can you tell us about that?**
            
“We are called Massachusetts recruiter Connection (MARC) which coincides with my name which is awesome. I started the group because I was in a similar group in Michigan, where I got great referral partners from, legal advice, and techniques for targeting specific people. For example, they had a speaker who taught us how to work with veterans; how to understand their jargon and how their job titles relate. There was nothing like this in the greater Boston area so I created MARC. We meet regularly at quarterly events and we are a recruiting specific group with the purpose to learn new techniques, procedures, laws regarding our field and create a referral network. I wanted another avenue of candidates and a resource for knowledge and industry growth.”
