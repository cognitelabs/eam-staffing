Quitting a new job is like returning an item of clothing that is too small. It hurts the ego, but will do wonders for comfort in the long run.

Everyone makes mistakes, and maybe this one wasn’t yours, maybe the company is not what you thought it would be.

That is okay, turns out, you’re not alone. In fact, a survey done by BambooHR in February 2014, found about one third of 1,000 people surveyed had quit their jobs in the first 6 months. It also said that 16-17% quit within the first three months. Whether you’re leaving due to management, unclear job descriptions, or it’s just an incorrect fit, we hope this article can help you discover the best way to let them go.

## 1. Acknowledge the Stress of Leaving a New Job
Quitting a new job is not only stressful to you, but also the company who is about to lose your talent. It also has repercussions on the connections that might have helped you get your foot in the door in the first place. That's why being respectful and seeking to minimize damange is essential.

## 2. Quit In-Person
Tell all parties involved in person. First and foremost, tell the person who helped you get the new job.

Chances are, they put themselves out there for you and really thought it was a good fit. No matter what your relationship with them, they’ll appreciate the heads up and should understand. Next, have that difficult conversation with your boss, in-person. Be frank, tell them why so that they can adjust for your replacement.

## 3. Give at Least Two Weeks' Notice
Offer two weeks notice or to stay until they find your replacement. This is an important step in preserving relations with all parties involved and doesn’t leave the company over-loaded with work. If possible, try to figure out what it would take for you to stay. Maybe the issues pushing you to leave can be resolved. Try to be open to work it out.

## It's Never Easy
Though these tips seem obvious, when the time comes, they are not so easy to carry out. Successfully resigning a new job will take  ten seconds of bravery to find your superior and have this difficult conversation. The longer you wait, the harder this will become and the more frustrated you will be with your job. It’s not easy, but it will be worth it…. The best way to avoid this scenario, do more research and vetting of the companies you’re applying to and check out EAM Staffing’s blog for tips on successful interviewing. Good luck.
