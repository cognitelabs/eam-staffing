				<h2>Step 2: Find</h2>
				<p>
				Most companies over-value “experience."  There is a fine line between finding someone with 5 years experience or someone with one year experience repeated 5 times. Our recruiters proactively gauge interest with the candidates that match our SEARCH criteria which expands way beyond “experience."  We understand the ponds, lakes and oceans we fish in.  We will find the top players that aren't looking and may not be the obvious fit.</p>
