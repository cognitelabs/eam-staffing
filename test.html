								<h4 class="heading-primary mb-none">Economic Liberty</h4>
								<p class="tall" style="font-size:12px; line-height: 16px;">Economies don't work if people don't participate. Everyone should have the freedom to participate in economic exchange in the manner that best suits their abilities and interests. This guarantees more motivated producers and better products. We believe in eliminating artificial restrictions that prevent potential producers from entering the market, and in helping people fulfill their optimum economic potential by showing them how they can make use of their talents and resources. By adding those talents and resources to the market, we enrich both the market itself and our communities as a whole. It's all part of building a better future.</p>

								<h4 class="heading-primary mb-none">Creative Action</h4>
								<p class="tall" style="font-size:12px; line-height: 16px;">Everyone talks about innovation and we all know we need it. We happen to believe you should live it, too. We look for people who have dynamic and original ideas for business and show them how to turn those ideas into profitable, sustainable business solutions that work for them. And all the while, we ensure that those ideas are developed in ways that benefit not only the originators, but their communities as a whole. We live in an age of untold innovation - and sometimes it seems like all the blank spaces on the map have been filled in. That's why we go out to the edge and find the dragons.</p>

								<h4 class="heading-primary mb-none">Stewardship</h4>
								<p class="tall" style="font-size:12px; line-height: 16px;">It's not enough to just exist anymore. It never really was. Just as economic liberty expresses every individual's right to participate in valuable economic and social endeavors, stewardship expresses the concomitant responsibility to do so. Humanity as a whole possesses a singular power over the fate of all life on planet earth - most of all our own. Not only do we possess a moral responsibility to ensure that earth enjoys a bright and productive future, but it is also in our best interest to do so. By helping to ensure the creation of businesses that are not only profitable, but also economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable, we express our commitment to building a better, brighter world for the generations who come after us.</p>

								<h4 class="heading-primary mb-none">Entrepreneurship</h4>
								<p class="tall" style="font-size:12px; line-height: 16px;">Creative action and entrepreneurship go hand in hand. Where creative action is all about having ideas and the will to put them into practice, entrepreneurship is the business acumen and leadership necessary to make those ideas into successfully marketable products. We know what entrepreneurship is all about, because we're entrepreneurs ourselves - and one of the reasons we got into this business in the first place is so that we can help other people foster their own pioneering spirit. We provide tools and talent to help our fellow entrepreneurs make the most of the innovation they already possess.</p>

								<h4 class="heading-primary mb-none">Humanity</h4>
								<p class="tall" style="font-size:12px; line-height: 16px;">The meaning of humanity transcends mere biology. We know that every person possesses the spirit of creation, the spark that drives all of us to be more than we are. People aren't just commodities - they have intrinsic value, and they deserve to be allowed to express their abilities in whatever form that value takes, and in whatever way best suits their talents and motivations. The more we help people express their skills, the more they can help us, and the more value they add to any endeavor they participate in. Fostering this spirit of shared, creative humanity, we enrich not only ourselves, but everyone. Every person is like a candle - and when we strike enough sparks, we can light the world.</p>
